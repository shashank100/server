        <Collapsible trigger="What’s it made of?">
          <p>Every Eggsential product is made of 100% real liquid egg whites procured from healthy eggs of hygienic hens from duly certified hatcheries of Punjab and Haryana. Eggsential is the same thing as if you cracked your own eggs and separated the whites from the yolks. No substitutes,powders, harmful chemicals or any kind of artificial preservatives are used in Eggsential Products . What makes Eggsential different is that we double pasteurize the egg whites to kill any harmful pathogen or microbes, if any, and pack them into a clean hygeinic and convienient packaging.</p>

          <p>Eggsential Products are 100% bio available i.e. the entire protein content of Eggsential Products gets digested and absorbed in the body. Therefore, It is your choice! If you are already consuming any protein supplements as a part of your diet or otherwise you may substitute the same by Eggsential Product if you like.

        <Collapsible trigger="How can we store Eggsential?">
          <p>Because Eggsential is perishable, you’ll want to always store it in the fridge or freezer. You can keep it frozen for up to 3 months until you’re ready to open a jug. Once it has been opened and/or unfrozen we recommend storing in a fridge between 4-8 degrees. It will stay healthy and fit in the fridge for 3 weeks giving you plenty of time to use it. In order to ensure a smooth consistency, we recommend NOT to re-freeze Eggsential.</p>
        </Collapsible>
        <Collapsible trigger="How long can Eggsential stay good?">
          <p>Eggsential is made fresh every week and because it’s a whole food, it is perishable. You can keep it frozen for up to a year and it’ll still be good. Once thawed, you can keep it fresh in the fridge for another 20 days or so. Keep in mind that in order to maintain a smooth consistency and freshness we do not recommend to re-freeze Eggsential egg whites after it has already thawed.</p>
        </Collapsible>
        <Collapsible trigger="What’s the best way to thaw Eggsential?">
          <p>The best way to thaw it is in the fridge. This can take a few days depending on the temperature of your fridge. To quickly thaw, you can leave it in open for 4 hours. After every four hours shake it up and put it in the fridge if you are not consuming immediately. Repeat if necessary. The quickest method is to put it in the sink with cold water and let it thaw completely there. We don’t recommend leaving it out for more than 4-6 hours at a time. After it has thawed completely, make sure you don’t leave it out for more than an hour.</p>
